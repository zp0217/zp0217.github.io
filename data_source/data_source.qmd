These data are the day-to-day prices of the euro, pound, and yen against the U.S. dollar. They’re the core “what actually moved” series for this project. from these data, it is possible to observe trends and turning points, measure daily changes, and check how the big currencies move together over time.

# Data source 2: BIS data portal(effective exchange rate)

Instead of looking at one pair(data source 1), these indices show how a currency is doing against a basket of trading partners (and, for REER, adjust for inflation). This data gives a more fair view of international competitiveness. It helps to connect currency moves to trade and make sure findings aren’t just about the dollar.

# Data source 4:  FRED data on WTI Crude Oil price

By tracking oil, we can test whether energy shocks spill into currency moves (for example, whether sharp oil spikes push certain currencies up or down).

these data set are yield curve data for US,Japan,Uk and Euro.These are benchmark borrowing costs for each region in the short and long run.
