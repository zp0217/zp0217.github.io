    "text": "What is a Time Series? A time series is any sequence of measurements taken at regular, equally spaced intervals—seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, quarters, or years. Common examples include weather (daily temperature or rainfall), financial markets (daily stock prices or returns), industry indicators (monthly production or sales), electricity demand, traffic counts, and hospital admissions. In time-series analysis we study how these values evolve: their level, trend, seasonal or calendar patterns (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, holiday effects), cycles, and anomalies. Typical goals are to describe behavior clearly, forecast future values, and quantify the impact of events or policies.\nBecause observations are ordered in time, nearby points tend to be correlated (autocorrelation). This violates the independent-and-identically-distributed assumption behind many standard statistical methods, so naïve cross-sectional tools often mislead. Time-series work must explicitly handle dependence, trend, and seasonality—for example by differencing, seasonal adjustment, and models that use lagged values and errors (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA, ARIMAX/SARIMAX with external drivers, VAR for multiple series, state-space/ETS, or GARCH when volatility changes over time). Analysts also watch for structural breaks (e.g., policy shifts, COVID), outliers, and missing periods, and they evaluate models with time-aware validation (rolling or blocked splits) rather than random shuffles."

    "text": "Time series analyis in FX market and multi-assets\n1\nWe bump into exchange rates more often than we realize—when we travel, shop online from overseas retailers, or invest in foreign stocks and funds. An exchange rate is simply the price of one currency in terms of another, but that price ripples through everyday budgets and corporate balance sheets alike. In other words, FX sits at the seam between micro decisions (what a family pays for imports) and macro outcomes (inflation, trade balances, and monetary policy). The foreign-exchange (FX) market is where those prices are set. It is a cornerstone of global finance not only because of its scale, but because it compresses a huge amount of information about growth prospects, interest-rate paths, and cross-border trade into a single number that moves every second. FX is also policy-relevant: shifts in exchange rates can tighten or loosen financial conditions, influence exporters’ competitiveness, and feed directly into inflation. This project examines how four major currency blocs—the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Eurozone—interact with global asset classes through exchange rates and sovereign bond yields. The goal of this project is to understand currency dynamics and analyze the impact of the FX market to other financial assets.\n\n\nBig picture\nThis project focuses on four widely used and highly influential currencies—the US dollar (USD), euro (EUR), British pound (GBP), and Japanese yen (JPY). These are not just FX workhorses; they also anchor activity in other markets like equities, bonds, commodities, and ETFs. When currencies move, portfolio returns, hedging costs, and corporate earnings move with them. Currencies also take a crucial part in macroeconomic perspective—they transmit policy signals and real-economy shocks across markets. Rate cycles, yield-curve shifts, energy swings, and trade flows show up first (or most clearly) in the USD–EUR–GBP–JPY complex and then ripple into risk assets. By organizing evidence across rates, trade, and market behavior, this project builds a coherent narrative of how FX connects the real economy to financial outcomes. The goal of this project is to track how these exchange rates evolve and how they interact with the broader investment universe. Using a data-science workflow—cleaning and aligning time-series, modeling seasonality and volatility, and testing for structural breaks, this project will focus on five main ideas:\n\nCurrency dynamics: Currencies are complex financial assets that embody a country’s money and policy backdrop, and because FX sits at the center of global pricing and risk, this project will trace how major USD moves against JPY, EUR, and GBP arise and when those moves act as safe-haven signals or amplify risk across markets.\nGovernment bond yield curve: The yield curve summarizes how governments borrow across maturities and encodes expectations for growth and inflation, and since shifts in the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Euro area curves drive relative value and currency direction, this project will map how those changes translate into FX leadership.\nCommodity market : Commodity prices—especially crude oil—link the real economy to market risk by shaping costs and inflation pressure, and because oil swings often trigger turning points in risk appetite, this project will identify when commodity shocks align with currency moves and when they send a conflicting signal.\nEquity market : The stock market is the most familiar lens on market reaction and the S&P 500 distills broad risk and growth sentiment, so this project will track how equity surges and drawdowns relate to currency moves and spotlight moments when stocks confirm or contradict the message from FX.\nCrypto market : The crypto market is new and highly volatile, often reacting fastest to liquidity and sentiment shifts, and this project will document when Bitcoin’s moves align with currency signals and when they diverge, clarifying whether crypto behaves as a risk barometer or an outlier.\n\nBy the end, this project aims to translate these signals into clear, practical guidance: FX market movement and impact to other assets, and later how this can help create an investment portfolio.\n\n\n\nAnalytical Angels\n\nCurrency dynamics: Examine how major USD pairs (USD/JPY, USD/EUR, USD/GBP) encode shifting policy, trade, and risk conditions and how those shifts cascade into other markets.\nGovernment bond yield curve: Track how changes in U.S., U.K., Japan, and Eurozone 2Y &10Y curves—and their cross-country spreads—reorder FX leadership and global risk tone.\nCommodity & Risk interaction: Identify when oil shocks align with or contradict currency signals, revealing regime-dependent links between real-economy pressure and market risk.\nStock market & Risk interaction (S&P 500): Relate equity surges and drawdowns to concurrent currency moves to pinpoint when stocks confirm or challenge the message from FX.\nCrypto & Risk: Detect periods when Bitcoin behaves as a risk barometer versus an outlier, and assess whether its swings add information beyond equities and rates for FX.\n\n\n\nGuiding Questions\n\nWhen the U.S. 10-year yield rises, how quickly and by how much do USD/JPY, USD/EUR, and USD/GBP respond?\nDo cross-country yield spreads (US–JP, US–UK, US–DE) consistently lead major FX moves, or does their influence vary by regime?\nDuring risk-off episodes, does FX behave as a safe-haven signal (USD and JPY strength) or does that pattern break down?\nHow often do oil price shocks align with dollar moves, and when do they send conflicting signals about global risk?\nDo seasonal patterns in oil meaningfully change the relationship between commodities and major currency pairs?\nAre large equity swings in the S&P 500 typically preceded by FX moves, or do equities more often lead currencies?\nWhen volatility rises (VIX or oil volatility), does currency volatility jump at the same time or with a lag?\nDoes Bitcoin move with risk-on/risk-off in a way that adds information beyond equities and yields for anticipating FX moves?\nAround major policy announcements (FOMC, ECB, BoE, BoJ), are currency reactions dominated by local rates, cross-country spreads, or broader risk sentiment?\nAcross tranquil vs stressed market regimes, which driver—rates, commodities, equities, or crypto—explains the largest share of currency movement?\n\n\n\nLiterature reviews\n\nFX market\n\nRecent macro–finance work argues that exchange rates embed risk and demand shocks that co-move with interest differentials and macro quantities. Kekre and Lenel (2024)2 show—in a general-equilibrium setting matched to U.S.–G10 data—that persistent relative demand shocks (reflected in persistent yield differentials) account for the bulk of dollar volatility, while intermediation shocks explain short-horizon UIP deviations and crisis appreciation. This perspective motivates treating major USD crosses as a hub that concentrates evolving risk and policy information, guiding our currency-dynamics angle to read FX movements alongside rate differentials and broader risk signals2.\n\nBond yield\n\nOn cross-border monetary transmission,Engler, Ferrucci, Zabczyk, and Zheng (2024)3 provide fresh evidence that ECB tightening shocks spill over strongly to Emerging Europe: government bond yields rise more than one-for-one, sovereign spreads widen, local currencies depreciate, and output slows. Their event-study and local-projection results underscore that policy shocks abroad can reshape relative yield curves and FX simultaneously, reinforcing our yield-curve angle’s focus on U.S.–foreign 10-year spreads and on announcement windows when leadership in FX can shift quickly3.\n\nCommodity\n\nCommodity–FX linkages are state-dependent. Using VAR and DCC-GARCH connectedness, Ben Salem, Zayati, Nouira, and Rault (2024)4 document time-varying volatility spillovers between oil and major exchange rates, with spillovers intensifying in crisis phases (COVID-19, Russia–Ukraine) and easing in calmer periods. This supports treating oil both as a real-economy driver and as a risk transmitter, and it justifies regime-aware reading of oil shocks when interpreting currency moves commodity–risk angle4.\n\nEquity\n\nEquity–FX interactions are particularly pronounced in extremes. Li, Xie, Ouyang, Mo, and Feng (2024)5 use a tail-event network for the G20 and find that tail risk spillovers predominantly run from stocks to FX, with Europe and the U.S. acting as major transmitters. This evidence validates monitoring stock-market stress as a precursor to large currency moves, shaping our equities–risk angle to emphasize tail episodes rather than average correlations5.\n\nCrypto\n\nCrypto’s role in the risk ecosystem has matured post-2022. Narayan and Kumar (2024)6 show that interconnectedness and risk spillovers span cryptocurrencies, sectoral equities, exchange rates, metals, and energy, and that connectedness varies over time. For crypto–risk angle, this supports treating Bitcoin as a regime-dependent risk barometer whose signals can either add information beyond equities and yields or decouple in quieter phases6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In Japan, the 2Y and 10Y yields were held near zero for years under negative rates and yield curve control, leaving the curve unnaturally flat until 2023–24, when the BoJ began loosening its grip and long-term yields finally adjusted upward. In the U.S., rapid Fed hikes in 2022–23 drove the 2Y sharply higher, while the 10Y lagged, producing one of the deepest inversions in decades before signs of steepening emerged as growth expectations stabilized. The euro area saw the ECB raise rates later, with 2Y yields jumping in response, while the 10Y stayed more restrained due to weak growth prospects and sovereign debt sensitivities. In the U.K., yields reflected both high inflation and fiscal credibility: the 2Y surged with persistent inflation, while the 10Y showed episodes of market stress, most dramatically during the 2022 “mini-budget” crisis. Viewed together, these curves capture the common theme of inflation-driven tightening but also the distinct vulnerabilities and policy legacies shaping each market."

The yield curve spread — the gap between long-term (10Y) and short-term (2Y) bond yields — condenses the full yield curve into a single, easy-to-read signal. Normally, the 10Y sits above the 2Y because investors demand compensation for lending further into the future. When the spread narrows or turns negative, it reflects either central banks driving short rates sharply higher or markets anticipating weaker growth ahead. For this reason, the 10Y–2Y spread is one of the most closely followed indicators of the business cycle.\nLinking back to the previous yield plots, the spread highlights in one line what was visible across four separate curves. In the U.S., rapid Fed hikes lifted 2Y yields above 10Y yields, creating a deep inversion in 2022–23 that matched the flattening shown in the U.S. yield curve panel. In the euro area, a later and milder tightening cycle kept inversions shallower, consistent with the weaker 10Y response seen earlier. In the U.K., spreads swung more violently, echoing the gilt turmoil of the 2022 mini-budget and the inflation-driven spikes visible in both ends of the curve. Meanwhile, Japan remained flat for decades under yield curve control, and only after 2023 did its spread widen modestly as the BoJ began dismantling its policy framework.\nBy compressing the story of the individual yield curves, the spread plot makes it easier to compare cycles across countries. It shows not only where each economy sits in the global tightening narrative, but also how quickly — or slowly — their policies allow the curve to invert and recover.\n\ndata cleaning & plot code for oil price,sp500 price, bitcoin price\n\n\nCode\n# oil price \noil_price &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/oil\", \"crude_oil.csv\"))%&gt;%\n  rename(Date = observation_date, WTI = DCOILWTICO) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date),\n         WTI = as.numeric(WTI))\n\noil_vix &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/oil\",\"oil_vix.csv\"),\n                    col_names = c(\"Date\", \"OILVIX\"),\n                    skip = 1) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date),\n         OILVIX = as.numeric(OILVIX))\n\n\noil_merged &lt;- inner_join(oil_price, oil_vix, by = \"Date\")\n\noil_plot &lt;- plot_ly(oil_merged, x = ~Date) %&gt;%\n  add_lines(y = ~WTI, name = \"WTI Crude oil(USD)\", line = list(color = \"green\")) %&gt;%\n  add_lines(y = ~OILVIX, name = \"Crude oil VIX\", yaxis = \"y2\", line = list(color = \"red\")) %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"WTI Crude Oil vs OIL VIX\",\n    yaxis = list(title = \"WTI Price (USD)\", side = \"left\"),\n    yaxis2 = list(title = \"OIL VIX\", overlaying = \"y\", side = \"right\"),\n    legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.7)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n# bitcoin price\n\nbtc &lt;- read_csv(\n  here(\"data/btc\", \"btc.csv\"),\n  skip = 2,\n  col_names = c(\"Date\",\"Open\",\"High\",\"Low\",\"Close\",\"AdjClose\",\"Volume\"),\n  col_types = cols(\n    Date = col_date(format = \"%Y-%m-%d\"),\n    Open = col_double(),\n    High = col_double(),\n    Low = col_double(),\n    Close = col_double(),\n    AdjClose = col_double(),\n    Volume = col_double()\n  )\n)\n\n\nbtc_vol &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/btc\",\"btcvol.csv\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))\n\n\nbtc_all &lt;- inner_join(\n  btc %&gt;% select(Date, Close, Volume),\n  btc_vol %&gt;% select(date, price, volatility, volatility60),\n  by = c(\"Date\" = \"date\")\n)\n\n\nbtc_plot &lt;- plot_ly(btc_all, x = ~Date) %&gt;%\n  add_lines(y = ~price, name = \"BTC Price (USD)\", line = list(color = \"gold\"), yaxis = \"y1\") %&gt;%\n  add_lines(y = ~volatility, name = \"Daily Volatility\", line = list(color = \"red\", width = 1), yaxis = \"y2\") %&gt;%\n  add_lines(y = ~volatility60, name = \"60-day Volatility\", line = list(color = \"darksalmon\", width = 2), yaxis = \"y2\") %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Bitcoin Price vs Volatility (Daily & 60-day)\",\n    yaxis = list(title = \"BTC Price (USD)\", type = \"log\"), \n    yaxis2 = list(title = \"Volatility\", overlaying = \"y\", side = \"right\"),\n    legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.9)\n  )\n\n\n\n# S&P 500 price\n\nsp500 &lt;- read_csv(\n  here(\"data/sp500\",\"sp500.csv\"),\n  skip = 1,\n  col_names = c(\"Date\",\"Open\",\"High\",\"Low\",\"Close\",\"AdjClose\",\"Volume\"),\n) %&gt;% slice(-1,-2)%&gt;%\n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))\n\n\nsp500_vix &lt;- read_csv(\n  here(\"data/sp500\",\"sp500_vix.csv\")\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Date = as.Date(DATE, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")) %&gt;%\n  select(Date, VVIX)\n\nsp500_all &lt;- inner_join(\n  sp500 %&gt;% select(Date, Close),\n  sp500_vix,\n  by = \"Date\"\n)\n\n\nsp_plot &lt;- plot_ly(sp500_all, x = ~Date) %&gt;%\n  add_lines(y = ~Close, \n            name = \"S&P500 Index\", \n            line = list(color = \"blue\"), \n            yaxis = \"y1\") %&gt;%\n  add_lines(y = ~VVIX, \n            name = \"VVIX\", \n            line = list(color = \"red\"), \n            yaxis = \"y2\") %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"S&P500 Index vs VVIX\",\n    yaxis = list(title = \"S&P500 Index\", type = \"log\"),   \n    yaxis2 = list(title = \"VVIX\", overlaying = \"y\", side = \"right\"),\n    legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.9)\n  )\n\n\n\noil price & volatilitybtc price & volatilityS&P500 price & volatility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil prices and volatility (OILVIX) capture the most direct link between geopolitics, supply shocks, and inflation. Spikes in both price and volatility — such as during the 2022 energy shock following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — fed directly into the inflation pressures that drove central banks to tighten policy, which we saw earlier in the steep climbs of 2Y yields. When oil trends higher with calmer volatility, it signals demand-led growth rather than supply stress, tying back to the more reflationary phases of the yield curves.\nThe S&P 500 vs. VVIX reflects how equity markets absorb those same cycles. Periods of rising policy rates and yield-curve inversions often coincide with weaker equity performance and elevated volatility-of-volatility, as investors hedge against uncertainty. Conversely, when the curve begins to steepen again — signaling expectations of easing — equities tend to recover and VVIX subsides. This makes equities a natural “mirror” to the fixed-income story told in the spread plot.\nFinally, Bitcoin and its volatility offer a high-beta, speculative lens on the same macro environment. Crypto tends to rally during periods of abundant liquidity and risk-on sentiment, but volatility spikes sharply around regime shifts, such as the 2024 halving event. Its behavior often amplifies what is seen in equities: confidence during easing cycles, stress during tightening phases.\nTogether, these three panels illustrate how macro forces traced through FX and yields cascade into commodities, equities, and crypto. Oil shapes inflation and policy responses, equities reflect growth expectations and investor sentiment, and Bitcoin amplifies the extremes of risk appetite. Read alongside the earlier plots, they complete the picture of how global shocks ripple across every corner of the financial system."

after this period, with recovery period until 2020 and also decreases severly. in real economic situation, this reflects 2008 economic crisis and 2020 pandemic. eventually time series FX rate against USD shows impact of economic crisis. this also reflects FX rate has cyclic patterns. also for seasonality, it is hard to detect it.\n\nCrude oil:\n\ncrude oil shows less movement relavantly to other assets. however, oil price also reflects economic situation, such as 2020 pandemic. one thing to note in crude oil price is that in terms of monthly, its movement has some kind of patterns.\n\nS&P 500 index:\n\nS&P500 graph showing upward trend as time goes by, specifically sharp upward trend for 2023. this plot as reflects economic situation, for example in 2025 first quarter, it decreases sharply, which this time, there was a tariff war, made investment slump due to economic & policy unstability.\n\nBitcoin:\n\nBitcoin is very similar as S&P500 but much radical movement, after 2023, it increases very sharply. it is hard to find seasonality or cycllic pattern for this data\n\nyield curve spreads:\n\nIn yield curve spread( 10 year - 2 years ), three countries have similar pattern, but Japan has distinct pattern compare to other countries. Japan has increasing spread rate after 2020 whereas other countries has shifts. spreads generally a sign for economic policy expectation, as spread increases it could mean downward on inflation or better economic situation, whereas decrease could mean tightening from central bank, impacting investment and sign for bad economics.\n\n\nLag plots\n\nJPY currency rateGBP currency rateEUR currency ratecrude oil priceS&P500 indexBitcoin priceJapan spread rateEuro spread rateUK spread rateUS spread rate\n\n\n\n\nCode\njp_ts &lt;- ts(jp$USD_JP, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(jp$USD_JP))))\ngglagplot(jp_ts, do.lines=FALSE) +\n          xlab(\"Lags\")+ylab(\"JYP/USD\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nuk_ts &lt;- ts(uk$UK_USD, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(uk$UK_USD))))\ngglagplot(jp_ts, do.lines=FALSE) +\n          xlab(\"Lags\")+ylab(\"UK/USD\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\neu_ts &lt;- ts(eu$EUR_USD, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(eu$EUR_USD))))\ngglagplot(jp_ts, do.lines=FALSE) +\n          xlab(\"Lags\")+ylab(\"EU/USD\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncrude_oil_ts &lt;- ts(crude_oil$WTI, frequency = 365, start = c(year(min(crude_oil$WTI))))\ngglagplot(jp_ts, do.lines=FALSE) +\n          xlab(\"Lags\")+ylab(\"Crude oil price\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsp500_ts &lt;- ts(sp500$Close, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(sp500$Close))))\ngglagplot(jp_ts, do.lines=FALSE) +\n          xlab(\"Lags\")+ylab(\"S&P500 index \") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbtc_ts &lt;- ts(btc$Close, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(btc$Close))))\ngglagplot(jp_ts, do.lines=FALSE) +\n          xlab(\"Lags\")+ylab(\"Bitcoin price\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\njp_spread_ts &lt;- ts(spread$JP_Spread, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(spread$JP_Spread))))\n\ngglagplot(jp_spread_ts, do.lines = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Lag Plots of japan_spread\",\n       x = \"Lags\", y = \"Japan spread %\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\neu_spread_ts &lt;- ts(spread$EU_Spread, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(spread$EU_Spread))))\n\ngglagplot(eu_spread_ts, do.lines = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Lag Plots of euro_spread\",\n       x = \"Lags\", y = \"Euro spread %\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nuk_spread_ts &lt;- ts(spread$UK_Spread, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(spread$UK_Spread))))\n\ngglagplot(uk_spread_ts, do.lines = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Lag Plots of UK_spread\",\n       x = \"Lags\", y = \"Uk spread %\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nus_spread_ts &lt;- ts(spread$US_Spread, frequency = 252, start = c(year(min(spread$US_Spread))))\n\ngglagplot(us_spread_ts, do.lines = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Lag Plots of US_spread\",\n       x = \"Lags\", y = \"US spread %\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby observing Lag plots, all the variables has similar conclusion; it is strongly linear, which is strongly autocorrelated and non-stationary.

results\n\ncrude oil, s&P500, bitcoin :\n\nthese data decays very radically, for crude oil and S&P500 it goes to negative value, which can say there is an inverse realtionship for observation k time step apart. for PACF, it also falls significantly after lag 0-1, showing correlation.\n\nspread rate :\n\nspread rate ACF also decays very radically, howevcer it doesn’t go to negative value except US spread rate, this might due that in time series plot, US rates are much radical compare to other country spread rate. for PACF plot, it can hold more lags; lag 2-3 or 4 is capable for spread rate plots, after that it is correlated. this result corresponds to lag plot since spread rate’s lag plot has less linear pattern compare to other data\n\n\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\nJPY currency
